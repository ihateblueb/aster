; See README for information

;	Aster Configuration

; URL Aster should expect to receive requests from.
; Do not change this after your instance has begun
; federating. Doing so will cause activity validation
; to fail.
; This must start with either https:// or http://
; and end with a /
; Subpaths are not supported. (e.g. https://example.com/aster)
url=http://localhost:9972/

; Port the instance will run on. As long as this isn't
; included in your URL, you can change this after you
; begin federating.
; e.g. 3000
port=9972

; Registration status
; 'open' allows anyone to register
; 'approval' requires an admin to approve an account
; before it can be used (reccomended)
; 'invite' requires a generated invite code
; 'closed' doesn't allow any registrations
registrations='closed'

; Type of ID format to use locally
; 'aidx' is fine, so are 'ulid' and 'uuidv7', the others are
; just for compatability.
; options: aidx, aid, meid, meidg, objectid, ulid, uuidv4, uuidv7.
id='aidx'

; Locale to be used in API errors
; If left empty, fallback is en_US
; See locales directory for options
locale=en_US

; Enables a timeline that shows public posts from
; instances of your choosing
bubbleTimeline=false

; Instances to use for the bubble timeline,
; local isn't included by default
bubbleInstances[]=

; Requires all GET requests to the instance to be signed
; like POSTs must be. Instance moderation rules are more
; effective this way.
authorizedFetch=false

[workers]


; Upon startup, this many processes will be
; started and run together. The reccomended
; maximum is the number of cores your CPU has.
count=4

[database]

; Typically, you won't need to change this.
host=localhost

; Port you'd use to connect to Redis
; Typically, you won't need to change this.
port=9977

; Prefix to put in front of keys.
; Typically, you won't need to set this, but
; it can be useful when using multiple softwares
; on one Redis instance.
prefix=

; Name of the database to use.
; Typically, this doesn't need to be set.
database=

; Username to use in Redis connection.
; If not exposed to the internet, you won't
; need to authenticate Redis.

pass=

[cache]


; Cache AP endpoint responses so that when a post is interacted
; from with a big account, less postgres queries are being made
ap=true

; How long AP objects should be cached, in seconds
; default is 150 (2.5 minutes)
apExpiration=150

; Cache certain API responses so that higher instance usage
; doesn't mean excessive postgres queries
api=true

; How long API responses should be cached, in seconds
; default is 30
apiExpiration=30

; Similar to API caching, but specifically for the /api/meta endpoint
; and nodeinfo endpoints. This can be higher since it's fetched less
meta=true

; How long meta API responses should be cached, in seconds
; default is 300
metaExpiration=300

[deliver]

; Maximum amount of jobs running at once
; eg. 25
concurrency=25

[inbox]

; eg. 25
concurrency=25
